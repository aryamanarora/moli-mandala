* **Readings**: Tikannen (1999) and Arsenault (2017) on retroflex typologies in South Asia. [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xSMn93s_9xOYpal4FV5-t4N2zU-MwSi4/view?usp=sharing).

Retroflexion is a defining areal feature of South Asia, and has been discussed for a bit more than half a century in the linguistic literature. All families present in South Asia (except maybe Andamanese) show retroflexion, generally of stops /ʈ, ɖ/ followed by sibilants /ʂ/ and affricates /ʈ͡ʂ/, and some more geographically-confined types like the retroflex flap /ɽ/, lateral /ɭ̆/, nasal /ɳ/, approximant /ɻ/ and vowels /V˞/.

Tikannen (1999) discusses the typology of retroflexes (basically, two types A and B, the latter has sibilants/affricates while the former does not) and makes some very bold claims about how retroflexion developed in all these genetically unrelated languages in South Asia. For examples, he says Indo-Aryan probably picked it up from Dravidian (debatable) while migrating into the Punjab and perhaps through the Dravidian Indus (extremely controversial). Arsenault (2017) gives a statistic analysis of the retroflex typologies, discarding Tikkanen's two groups.
