            "content": "Readings: Emeneau (1991) on some etymological issues with Brahui pronouns and Elfenbein (1987) on the history of Brahui migration. | . The ffirst-person oblique in k- . Brahui has first person oblique in k- which is very unusual in the broader Dravidian family, and is the focus of the first reading. The Dravidial 1sg.pron has been reconstructed as *yān, and there’s no regular sound change that explains k- in Brahui (usually &lt; *c). Several theories have been put forth about this (many involving a suffix such as oblique -ku being prefixed unusually) that Emeneau summarises. There are some other instances of k- appearing without etymological basis too (Ramaswamy). . Interestingly, Elamite has -k (suffixed) in the first person plural. We went off into a side discussion on Elamo-Dravidian pronouns here, and Gopalakrishnan noted this about the 2pl.pron: . “Original 2Sing nin- and ̄2Pl nim-. nim- &gt; num-, and nin- is analogized to nun-. Then nun- &gt; un- in analogy with 1Sing en- (oblique of nAn-).” . From Emeneau’s paper, it seemed that we agreed that the appelative (cf. Classical Tamil) or dative (the well-known -k(k)u) source seems compelling; the latter even has a parallel in Kurux. Metathesis is the likely development if that proposal is true: enku &gt; ikan &gt; kan or something like that. Emeneau’s proposal of rebracketing with the plural needs a big corpus to really show possibility of, especially since it relies on a specific word order to work. . Brahui migration . About how the Brahui speakers got there: the usual consensus has been North Dravidian speakers migrated to around the Narmada and Islamic invasions scattered them, with Kurux-Malto going to Bihar/Jharkhand (the Chota Nagpur plateau) and Brahui going to Sindh and beyond. The alternative proposal is that Brahui is a conservative remnant of the initial Dravidian migration into India, and does not form a subfamily with Kurux-Malto. Kobayashi’s work seems to be pointing towards Kurux-Malto being separate from Brahui (and indeed that is becoming the scholarly consensus), so we need a rework of the first proposal. . The unique convergence/multilingualism situation between Brahui, Balochi, and (to some lesser extent) Jadgali was also discussed. I want to point out that Kholosi has a large Balochi stratum but no apparent Brahui one, but this is probably not useful evidence given (1) we don’t know about the Brahui-Jadgali situation sociolinguistically; they may not be in much direct contact like Jadgali-Balochi or Brahui-Balochi, and (2) Brahui has so little Dravidian vocabulary left that it’s less likely to be borrowed into another language. Also interesting: Brahui dialects spoken in Kerman province are being documented (and they show the usual neat stuff, including k- in the 1sg.pron.obl). .",

            "content": "Readings: Tikannen (1999) and Arsenault (2017) on retroflex typologies in South Asia. Drive link. | . Retroflexion is a defining areal feature of South Asia, and has been discussed for a bit more than half a century in the linguistic literature. All families present in South Asia (except maybe Andamanese) show retroflexion, generally of stops /ʈ, ɖ/ followed by sibilants /ʂ/ and affricates /ʈ͡ʂ/, and some more geographically-confined types like the retroflex flap /ɽ/, lateral /ɭ̆/, nasal /ɳ/, approximant /ɻ/ and vowels /V˞/. . Tikannen (1999) discusses the typology of retroflexes (basically, two types A and B, the latter has sibilants/affricates while the former does not) and makes some very bold claims about how retroflexion developed in all these genetically unrelated languages in South Asia. For examples, he says Indo-Aryan probably picked it up from Dravidian (debatable) while migrating into the Punjab and perhaps through the Dravidian Indus (extremely controversial). Arsenault (2017) gives a statistic analysis of the retroflex typologies, discarding Tikkanen’s two groups. .",

The discussion was broad and quite varied, given the nature of the reading. Future readings will probably not be the same; on the organisational side, for that reason, readings well happen every 2 weeks so that the intervening meetings are more open. . Some of the interesting discussion was on language contact and how that contributes to the difficulty of the tree model in describing South Asian language history. Areal features that have spread through contact that we discussed included retroflexion (note that even Great Andamanese1 and Burushaski have this, and Avestan’s /ʂ/). Also of interest were v &gt; b2 in Brahui, Kannada, and many Indo-Aryan languages, and s &gt; h in Iranian and Northwest IA, which seems to be more of a chance convergence. The fact that unrelated families seem to be affected by feature spread is a big challenge for historical linguistics, in making sense of shared innovations. . There does not seem to be much work on applying the wave model in South Asia at least, beyond some recent statistical attempts. In Indo-Aryan, this work is done by Chundra Cathcart and Taraka Rama. Nothing similar in Dravidian despite the existence of good resources like DEDR. Some interesting work has come out on admixture models etc. in recent years, such as Murawaki (2020) on Fijian.3 Note that the tree model has greater success in some regions than in others, and has been good for broad Indo-European reconstruction.4 Also interesting is regional reconstruction, which has been done by Toulmin for the north Bengal Indo-Aryan lects. . There was a short discussion in the comments about computational decipherment of “lost” languages which is really fascinating.5 Daggumati and Revesz (2019)6 had a paper attempted to group undeciphered scripts visually. A recent MIT article also was brought up. . We also discussed the principles behind sound change: can they be modelled statistically? Some sound changes are more likely cross-lingually (thinking of big databases that try to document these changes), such as palatalisation, but that does not seem to be a firm basis to rule out rarer changes.2 What principles are behind sound change? We discussed phonetic dispersion, the possibility of diglossia’s influence, and mutual reinforcement of seemingly unstable features like breathy-voice in South Asia. We also listened to Sunil Menon’s demonstration of Malayalam’s three-way stop /t̪ t ʈ/ contrast, and two-way rhotic /ɾ r/, both rare distinctions in South Asia. . Footnotes .
